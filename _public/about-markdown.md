# About

I am currently a Research Associate with the Boston College Institute for Scientific
Research working at the Air Force Research Lab.

I currently explore the reaction kinetics of charged metal/metal-oxide clusters or metal ions and neutral molecules.
I hold a PhD from UF where my research focus was plasmonic materials for solar photocatalysis.
