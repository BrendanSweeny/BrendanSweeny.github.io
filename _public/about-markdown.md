# About

I am currently a National Research Council Postdoctoral Associate working at the Air Force Research Lab.

I currently explore the reaction kinetics of charged metal/metal-oxide clusters or metal ions and neutral molecules.
I hold a PhD from UF where my research focus was plasmonic materials for solar photocatalysis.
